# Coil Wraps!

A small utility written in Ruby to help you build coils (often called heating coils) for DIY vaping. The app will ask you what your desired resistance is, the guage wire you are using and the size of your jig.

Currently the only supported wire is Kanthal-A1. In the future I will add support for more wire types, but in the meantime if you really like this util and wanna have a go adding your preferred wire type, send me a PR!

## Installation

    $ gem install coilwraps


## Usage

    $ coilwraps

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
