    This tool will help you determine the number of wraps needed to reach a desired ohm rating for a microcoil made from A-1 Kanthal resistance wire.
    Things you will need to know are as follows:
        - the wire gauge (AWG) you are using, 20-34 Guages supported,
        - the diameter (in millimeters) of the jig you are wrapping the coil around.
    FOO

    puts 'what is the desired resistance in ohms?'
    resistance = gets.chomp.to_f

    puts 'what is the wire guage (AWG)?'
    wire = gets.chomp.to_i

    # area calculation inspired by http://www.rapidtables.com/calc/wire/awg-to-mm.htm
    area = 0.012668 * 92**((36-wire)/19.5)

    puts 'what is the jig diameter in millimeters?'
    diameter = gets.chomp.to_f

    radius = diameter / 2
    circumference = radius * 2 * Math::PI

    # resistivity of kanthal A-1 is .00145 ohms*mm^2/mm
    resistivity = 0.00145

    coil_length = (resistance * area) / resistivity
    wraps = coil_length / circumference

    wraps = wraps.round

    puts "The number of wraps needed is #{wraps}, however remember to always measure your builds with a multimeter or ohmmeter. Vape safe."
